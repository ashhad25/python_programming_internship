# Task - Pixel-Perfect File Compression/Decompression Program (GUI Based)


As the name tells us this program not just accpets single file but also works for multiple files.


This file is created for the elements containing in this folder:


- .Py File
- .pdf File
- .ui File
- .exe File
- & lastly icon folder


So the .py file consist of the whole script of the program that can be run through there aswell.

But also can be run through the exe file.

.exe file is created for the easiness

while the ui file was created using Qt Designer

.pdf file consist of the document that was given to us to create the program

lastly the icon folder contain the window icon for the application

do install the libraries PyQt5,Tkinter,Gzip etc for the usage of program.

while do change the path if any mentioned in the code, if so.

Thanks for reviewing this, hope this file explains it.
